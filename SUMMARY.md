# Zoya AI Assistant - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Zoya is a multilingual, voice-based & text-based AI assistant similar to Jarvis, built with Python. It supports multiple languages, has both voice and text modes, and can respond using AI or web search.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-language Support
- Supports 6 languages: English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Spanish, French
- Language selection at startup
- Translation of AI responses using MyMemory API
- Language-specific speech recognition and text-to-speech

### 2. Voice and Text Modes
- **Voice Mode**: Speech input via microphone with speech recognition
- **Text Mode**: Keyboard input with text responses
- Both modes provide spoken responses using text-to-speech

### 3. AI Integration
- Uses OpenRouter API with x-ai/grok-4-fast:free model
- Language-aware prompts to get responses in the selected language
- Fallback to web search for general knowledge queries

### 4. Web Search
- DuckDuckGo integration for general knowledge queries
- Automatic cleaning of search results

### 5. Interrupt System
- Stop speech immediately with "stop" command or spacebar
- Proper handling of speech interruption in both modes

### 6. Text Cleaning
- Removes special characters before speaking
- Cleans text for better speech output
